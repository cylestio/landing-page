            <p>After ~10 years of software engineering, ~8 years messing around with AI and security research, ~6 years in product & leadership roles, ~3 years as a VC-backed startup CEO, and 1000+ hours of vibe coding — I feel like everything I've done so far was leading up to this moment.</p>

            <p>We're at a point where one person can build an entire company using AI — not just a demo, not just an MVP. Like, a <em>real</em> company.</p>

            <p>Some people call it "vibe coding."<br>
            Honestly? I don't love the term. It feels like it downplays what's actually happening.</p>

            <p>Because if you really want to build something serious, you'll quickly find that <strong>Vibe/PM-Prompting isn't enough</strong>.<br>
            You also need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>🧑‍💻 Dev-Prompting</li>
                <li>🏗 Architect-Prompting</li>
                <li>🔧 DevOps-Prompting</li>
                <li>🛡 SecOps-Prompting</li>
                <li>🧠 Executive-Prompting (today's post)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is the first in a series where I'll break down the mental models, prompting flows, and techniques I've developed after 1000+ hours of AI-native building.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>1. The Shift — From Roles to Departments</h3>

            <p>To explain what I mean by Executive Prompting, let me take you back almost 20 years.</p>

            <p>I worked behind the bar. I loved it — late nights, energy, creating great experiences.<br>
            Then I became a waiter in a chill daytime place. Same idea — reading people, adapting, creating flow.</p>

            <p>At some point I thought:<br>
            <strong>"I should open a restaurant."</strong></p>

            <p>But here's the thing:<br>
            Being a bartender or a waiter doesn't mean you can run the place.</p>

            <p>You also need to understand:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The kitchen</li>
                <li>Dishwashing</li>
                <li>Finance</li>
                <li>Marketing</li>
                <li>Pricing</li>
                <li>Hiring</li>
                <li>Training</li>
                <li>Vendors</li>
                <li>Interior design, even</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You don't need to <em>do</em> it all — but you better know how it works.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>2. The Problem — Prompting as a PM Only Gets You So Far</h3>

            <p>Now replace that restaurant with your startup.</p>

            <p>When you're coding with AI, you're not just the PM writing prompts.<br>
            You're also:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The engineer</li>
                <li>The architect</li>
                <li>The designer</li>
                <li>The QA</li>
                <li>The DevOps</li>
                <li>The AppSec</li>
                <li>The legal guy</li>
                <li>The growth person</li>
                <li>The marketing and sales expert</li>
                <li>The everything</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Let's say you start with a prompt like:</p>
            <blockquote>
                "Build a dashboard for monitoring AI agents"
            </blockquote>

            <p>The AI will probably give you a decent starting point — maybe a basic UI, some token stats, a backend endpoint.</p>

            <p>But that's just the beginning. That's Vibe-Coding.</p>

            <p>If you're actually trying to build a product — not just a feature — you'll quickly find yourself spinning up <strong>multiple parallel prompt flows</strong>, each handling a different part of the business.</p>

            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One flow is about <strong>monitoring logic</strong> — what are we tracking? Token usage? Latency? Errors?</li>
                <li>Another one is for <strong>frontend UX</strong> — how should this data be presented?</li>
                <li>Another covers <strong>infra and scale</strong> — can this handle thousands of sessions?</li>
                <li>A fourth handles <strong>security and compliance</strong> — are we logging PII? Do we need encryption?</li>
                <li>And one more for <strong>OSS vs SaaS strategy</strong> — what's open-source? What's paid?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You're not asking the AI one magical prompt that "does it all."</p>

            <p>You're acting like an exec — giving each "team" its own responsibility, its own prompt flow (and much more than just a prompt, more on that in later posts) — and making sure they align with each other.</p>

            <p>That's <strong>Executive Prompting</strong>.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>3. The Mindset — What Executive Prompting Really Means</h3>

            <p>It's not about being perfect — it's about being aware.</p>

            <p>You're still a solo builder. But mentally, you're running a company.</p>

            <p>So here's how I think through <strong>every major feature or flow</strong>:</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>4. The Checklist — Thinking Like an Organization</h3>

            <p>🧠 <strong>Product Strategy</strong><br>
            → Who is it for? What's the outcome? What's the business impact?</p>

            <p>👨‍💻 <strong>Engineering</strong><br>
            → Is it clean, testable, modular?</p>

            <p>🏗 <strong>Architecture</strong><br>
            → Does this integrate with the rest of the system?</p>

            <p>🔧 <strong>DevOps</strong><br>
            → Can we deploy this safely? Is it observable?</p>

            <p>🛡 <strong>Security</strong><br>
            → Are we creating attack vectors? Is anything exposed?</p>

            <p>⚖️ <strong>Compliance</strong><br>
            → Are we collecting sensitive data? Do we need to care?</p>

            <p>📈 <strong>Growth / Marketing</strong><br>
            → Can this drive real value? Is it measurable?</p>

            <p>🧯 <strong>Support / Ops</strong><br>
            → What happens when this breaks? Will we even know?</p>

            <p>Of course, all of this is most relevant when you're a true solo founder.
            But the same approach can be adapted as your organization grows — even if some (or all) of these departments already exist.
            The real shift isn't just about covering more ground — it's about rethinking how these teams collaborate and stay aligned in the agentic era, where humans and AI agents are building together.</p>

            <h3>5. The Insight — Building Without the Meetings</h3>

            <p>And here's the most beautiful part:</p>

            <p>You can actually use AI to operate as your <em>entire team</em> — with real expertise — across all of these domains.</p>

            <p>You can spin up "departments" that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Know their roles</li>
                <li>Execute with context</li>
                <li>Interact with each other</li>
                <li>And stay aligned</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All of this… without a single sync meeting.<br>
            (No more "align on how to align before we align.")</p>

            <p>We're entering a world where the org chart is virtual — but the business is real.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>You just need to know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What departments your business needs</li>
                <li>What they're responsible for</li>
                <li>And how they should collaborate</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That's what I'll break down in the next posts — with real, hands-on examples from my own builds.</p>
